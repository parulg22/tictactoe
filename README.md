# tictactoe
This project models the traditional tic tac toe game in which the user enters a row and column space to place the appropriate token. The second player is 
the computer, which randomly places its token in an empty spot. If the user enters a row and column space out of bound or one that is already full,
an error will display. In the future, I hope to further this project so that two users can play as player 1 and 2.
